              Most of StyleKit is free and open source. This policy covers the paid
              digital products we may offer (such as template packs), voluntary
              support payments, and any future subscription plans.

                If a paid digital product does not work as described, or you are unable
                to access what you purchased, contact us within 14 days of the purchase
                and we will make it right — with a fix, a replacement, or a full refund.
                Because digital files cannot be returned, we may decline refund requests
                that show signs of abuse, such as repeated purchases and refunds of the
                same item after the content has been downloaded.

              <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed">
                When you buy a downloadable product, you get access to the full content
                immediately. By completing the purchase you consent to immediate
                delivery and acknowledge that, where local consumer law allows it, the
                standard withdrawal period for distance sales may no longer apply once
                delivery has begun. This never limits the 14-day quality guarantee
                above or any rights that your local law makes mandatory.

                If we offer subscription plans, you can cancel at any time and keep
                access until the end of the paid period. We do not charge again after
                cancellation. Partial-period refunds are not provided unless required
                by law, except when a billing error on our side caused the charge.

              <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed">
                Voluntary support payments and tips are gifts that help cover servers,
                domains, and maintenance. They do not purchase a product or service and
                are non-refundable, except where a duplicate payment or a processing
                error occurred.

              <p className="text-muted leading-relaxed">
                Paid orders may be processed by a merchant-of-record partner (such as
                Paddle), which acts as the seller of record for the transaction. In
                that case refunds are issued through the partner&apos;s checkout and support
                flow, and their buyer terms apply alongside this policy. We will always
                help you route a request to the right place.
